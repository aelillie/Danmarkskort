Group G v0.9
==================

Features added since v0.8:
*First version of finding a shortest path from A to B
*A paragraph in the report discussing the implementation of the address search



“Features” discovered/added since v0.8:
*Shortest path does not draw the line from A and B’s exact positions. Some paths give NullPointerException.
*For every Edge added to the Graph another Edge object is created pointing in the opposite direction (A lot of memory when running Denmark)



Time usage in man hours:
* GUI (routepanel, closing windows, optionspanel) 	8 hours
* Report (address search)				20 hours
* More icons/which icon to show				5 hours
* Shortest path						30 hours
* Finding Nearest					5 hours
* Route Panel						2 hours
* Binary Search						1 hour
* Restructuring						3 hours

Wishlist for v0.10:
* A working shortest path function
* Different path for car and walking/bike
* Whiteboxtesting of an interesting part of the program
* More tests
* Routefinding output: e.g. turn left, drive 300 m, turn right and so on.
* Setting up the LaTeX format for our report

Feedback Request:
* Everytime we add an Edge to the Graph, another Edge object is created pointing in the opposite direction. Is there a smart way of avoiding this? For example by utilizing undirected edges in such situations and directed edges for one way streets?
