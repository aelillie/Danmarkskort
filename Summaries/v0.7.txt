Group G v0.7
==================

Features added since v0.6:
*Using multiple QuadTrees for less demanding draw at higher zoom levels
*A startup loadingScreen with ProgressBar, when loading from bin files.
*Progress bar when loading a bin file in the program.
*Formatted strings of  the search results
*Tests of QuadTree, Nearest Neighbor, AddressSearch, OSMHandler, Scalebar.
*Layers are now drawn in the correct order again
*Updated layer configuration, resulting in more objects to be drawn right
*QuadTrees can now store Icons too.
*Navigation with mouse and keyboard keys in the searchResult pane
*Upon choosing an address, the view is centered to this address

“Features” discovered/added since v0.6:
*When loading a new File don’t close loading Frame.
*Weird address format when searching in a binary file - it seems like a dot is added to the address
*When creating a binary file on one computer and running the program with that file on another computer, the icons don’t load because of changed paths in the icons’ URLs
*The program doesn’t pan to a street when this is chosen from the searchresults at the moment

Wishlist for v0.8:
* Load of icons working properly when running from jar file.
* Decrease in memory usage when running Denmark
* A larger test suite
* More layer configurations (“debug” of .osm file)
* Optimization of Transport map, so that it runs smoothly as with Standard map
* Shortest path algorithm implemented


Feedback Request:
*How should we test graphics, e.g. the drawing of the scalebar and such things (g.drawLine(..), g.drawImage ….)?
*How should we test methods that return void? 
*How do we make sure that icons gets saved properly in a binary file, so that they also get loaded when the binary file is run on a different computer (and therefore have different paths for the icon URL’s)
