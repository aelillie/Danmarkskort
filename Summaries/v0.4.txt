Group v0.4

==================

Features added since v0.3:
* Better use of the MVC design pattern, only view knows how to draw objects from model
* Coastlines processing is partly done - it does not work for all osm imports yet.
* Added more details.
* You can now load OSM files into the program while it is running. 
* Made use of Enums, creating easy way to switch “map type”; ex. want colorblind map
* Better distribution of task in the model package.
* Now possible to actually switch between map types explained above.
* Stopped parsing every address, just adding them using osm’s data
* The model now calculates the y-coordinate after the spherical Mercator projection 
and the view no longer uses an average latitude to distort the map onto a plane.

“Features” discovered/added since v0.3:
* Still addresses that don’t parse.
* Still some detail flaws when drawing certain areas.
* Runs out of heap space for large files such as Denmark - supposedly due to too many Address objects
* parseZIP() fails for larger files such as Denmark
* When the processed file doesn’t have any coastlines, everything is drawn as sea.



Time usage in man hours:
32 hours: 	Coastlines
20 hours: 	Refactoring of model classes and view, better separation of tasks.
12 hours:	Highway stroke increase on zoom in/out (not working properly)
4 hours: 	Mercator projection research and implementation
5 hours:	Being able to load new OSM files when the program is running
5 hours:	Adding config files for colorblind map and transport map
5  hours:	Working on better a functioning zoom and with more static zoom levels.
3  hours: 	Debugging, some areas wasn’t drawn correctly.
2 hours:	Code cleanup

Wishlist for v0.5:
* Complete and correct processing of coastlines
* Tests
* A method for sorting all objects so they will be drawn in correct order.
* Better Colorblind/Transport visualization.
* A scalebar upon the map
* Better address search

Feedback Request:
* We've moved the handling of how the map is vizualised over to the view as discussed. What do you think of this?
* Regarding heap space and large files errors as noted in the "Features". How do we deal with this?
* Overall, how is our progress so far. Are we moving in a good pace? 
* When our program is in fullscreen mode and you use “load”, 
the window closes itself down upon opening the JFilechooser. 
We have speculated that this might be due to the component specified as the parent of the JFilechooser 
(see the TODO in the openFilechooser method in the view) - but changing it to contentpane doesn’t change anything.
Why is this and how can we fix it?
